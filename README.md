# PaddleGame
My attempt at a Retro Pong game using Unity 2D

This is my first more or less completed project in unity just learning how to use the editor and getting used to using C#.

Might go back to clean up the code and use it practice new skills in the future.

For now, I am happy with the build and learned a lot!
